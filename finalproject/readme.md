For my final project I have decided to do a forested animation scene full of moving flora and fauna, with lightly fallen snow.  The premise of my animation is a moving background image of a redwood forest, that slightly moves on a repeated loop.  I have five background images that I want repeated on a loop to make it look like a moving art piece. Then I want to create several forest creatures in the forest through shape drawing.  These include a frog, squirrel, roating spinning flowers, and a bird. I would also like to create a little forest man as a moving cursor.  I would also like to add a cool feature, when you click a forest creature a sound will start playing and these sounds will be looped together based on how many forest creatures are clicked.  I would also like falling snow to happen on
