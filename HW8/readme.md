# HW 8 | Loops

This week in creative coding I learned about loops in code.  I played around with the code a lot, duplicating it several times  until I came up with the final result.  While I learned more about loops I had trouble with nesting loops.  To solve this issue I duplicated the code several times with only one loop on each code.  Then I merged my codes together.  It was a little easier for me to visual the code by duplicating it several times until I got the results desired.

In the visual it's been designed to when you click the screen there are three different visuals that will appear with an interaction. On one there are four lines that create an X shape that duplicate over and over again to make a diamond pattern on a purple background, then when you move the mouse the size of the diamonds get smaller or larger depending on mouse movements.  On the second interaction there is two ellipses (alien ships) with lines streaming out of them to represent a retractor beam(you know to make crop circles or get cows).  When you move the mouse along the screen the lines move and fan out.  On the last interaction there is a three different sized ellipses that are layered on top of each other to make an interesting shape of orb.  These orbs are then spread out along the x and y axis and filled with random blinking colors that I selected.  As you move the mouse across the screen the orbs get bigger or smaller in size.
