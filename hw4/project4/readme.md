# Project 4-Create a sketch



## This week in coding I learned how to draw a sketch. I played with Atom for hours trying to make my perfect self portrait. I wrote the longest bit of code I have ever written using many new functions.  The code I used the most was the ellipse, I used it multiple times for my eyes and polka dots on my dress. I learned about push and pop, sometimes I would be writing my code and all the sudden a line color or stroke would suddenly change, I figured out that sometimes I would forget to put push or pop.  This would create abnormalities throughout my picture, once I put in the appropriate push or pop the image would change back to how I would like it to look.

## Currently I am having problem with publishing my project into github desktop. I have written my issue into the issue board and am hoping to receive feed back.  I'm not quite sure what the problem is besides when I press the publish to origin button on the github desktop it takes forever then error messages me saying that the file is to large. I have gone back into my files and deleted older files and organized my files better, but the error is still occurring. Here is an image of my error message.
