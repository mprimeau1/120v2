## This week in coding I created a simple sketch and learned how to create a class.  The biggest thing this week was I learned what a constructor is  and how to create it.  I can see how it will be useful in the future for my codes.  In my sketch I made a frog face with an open mouth that jumps up and down on the screen.  One of the cooler things I put into the sketch was so that when you move the mouse around the screen, more and more frog faces appear on the screen based on the mouse movements.  I played around with the sketch a lot and picked a bunch of random greens and a few other colors to make it so that all the frog faces randomly change color (the stroke and fill colors are different and both change). Here is a screen shot of me checking my colors. ![Image](untitled.png)

## Overall this week I learned a lot more about coding, but I struggled when editing my code.  I felt like even when I was trying to do a small thing it caused waves of awfulness in my code, which I then would have to carefully read and edit.  It was a process of realizing that once I do something new I might have to go back into several places in the code to add the new thing I did.  Creating this. statements in the constructor is super important I found, because everything is different and needs its own x,y and radius.  I think even though I found this week frustrating, I think it will be super useful in the future.
