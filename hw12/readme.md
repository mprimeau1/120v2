# HW-12 Objects that Interact with Each Other

# [Live Sketch Link](https://mprimeau1.github.io/120v2/hw12/index.html)

This week I learned how to make an objects interact with other things.  In my sketch I created a bunch of different rectangles that do a bunch of weird things.  I set the sketch to always have 100 BuzzRect's moving around the screen at all times. Then I made it so that they move around the screen randomly from -5, to 5. Just like last week I created my own class this week and called it BuzzRect(referring to a rectangle buzzing around the screen). I then made the class do several things, buzzCheck, edgeHit, move, display. In the class I created a constructor with many this. statements.  With the display I created the image of the buzzRect they are randomly created with different dimensions of the rectangle, sometimes they are square and other various rectangle sizes. The BuzzRect's start out purple and when they hit the walls they change color(edgeHit), when they hit a vertical wall (with move) they turn blue and when they hit a horizonal wall they turn yellow. Finally I made a buzzCheck for all the little buzzRects that when they hit each other if they are yellow then they will turn a light purple color.

I can really see things happening with coding now, all the different things you can do.  It's exciting when I see the colors change on the screen, even this minor thing makes me excited for the next step.
