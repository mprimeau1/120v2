# HW-6 Algorithmic Sketch

## This week in creative coding I created a new type of sketch. I used various math functions to create a weird picture of the universe.  In my picture I have three planets that move with off the screen with the mouse. Various stars in the background, an alien space craft floating with a jumbled messages from the aliens.  I used a lot of var this week it really helped me with the moving of the planets, I used the map function on one of the planets for the mouse movements.  I used other various functions such as constrain, and random.  The most interesting thing I did in my sketch was the random words from the aliens.  I can really see the usefulness of this.

## The biggest issues I had this week was coming up with a concept for my sketch. It took me a long time to even come up with what I can do with math functions and eventually came up with the in space concept (from watching to much Ancient Aliens). I am looking forward to see what is in store for me next week.
