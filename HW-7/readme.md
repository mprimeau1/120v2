# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

In the original code there is a ball that moves in a zigzag pattern on the screen with a drag pattern behind it. Once the ball hits the edge of the screen the ball bounces back and continues the zig zag pattern slightly below the original pattern. When you click the mouse the ball speeds up and moves faster.
