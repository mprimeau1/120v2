## This week was interesting I got to learn more about pj5 and how to do some new basic things. I learned about backgrounds and canvas, about how to change the color mostly. I also learned about functions and some simple ones like step up and draw. With setup you always want to have that first then you can have whatever function after that, like draw.  You can use draw for several things like making an ellipse.

## The biggest problem I had figuring out how to make a webpage. I read some issues that other people were having and read that.  I feel like  haven't had any major issues yet. I simply just follow the given instructions and read all course material and it seems to work right.
